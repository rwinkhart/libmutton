**libmutton v0.4.0**
August 17, 2025

This is the largest update to libmutton yet, and as such, these patch notes are non-exhaustive.
Many minor changes and fixes to features mentioned in these patch notes have been made.
Please see the commit history for a more complete list of changes.

## Breaking (for users)
- GPG has been entirely replaced with [RCW](https://github.com/rwinkhart/rcw)
    - All entries created in previous versions must be converted using [this conversion program](https://github.com/rwinkhart/sshyp-labs/releases/tag/v2.0.0)
- Steam TOTP keys now must be in base32 format
- (3c5db78da9861e09112ac308c086c2d19f2abfeb) Release binaries of `libmuttonserver` now target x86_64_v2 and arm64v8.7
- (3dd07e7165874e323586c21a14853935bb3dc61c) Offline mode is now manually specified in libmutton.ini

## Breaking (for developers)
- libmutton has been further modularized
    - The `core` package has been split into `core`, `global`, `crypt`, and `cfg`

    - This decreases the size of the server binary and allows for more modular clients

- (3fdcc9e96d71bb4bef3baf9f43a627782237b142) (1a66a30bc184528ec971306497cca3597072202a) (d023058630958842f0f521ba2bef43b12955b9d8) Support one-time TOTP copy
- (fb2120c94ebc69f7ac8e15163f1e27b2c8057d9a) Support custom device ID prefixes

## Fixes
- (50ab27c6749d13fc6842d92259f8e0fd8fa5340c) libmutton.ini is now always created with 0600 permissions on *nix platforms
- (4a0e0f8e9e96805b27232001bce81336ac2e6a4d) Old devices IDs are no longer removed from clients when registration of a new device ID fails
