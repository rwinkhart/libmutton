**libmutton v0.4.1**
October 26, 2025

This is a dependency bump release with only minor changes for developers.

## Breaking (for developers)
- (b9175d7ff3bea3bc703c20468defebcb1ac7e412) Standardized on "password" rather than a mix of "passphrase"/"password"
    - Some function names changed as a result
- (aa10016f77b0be66ab75279df967f5d080d2b826) Developers using `LibmuttonInit` can now force clients into offline mode programmatically
    - This means `LibmuttonInit` now requires an extra parameter

## Dependencies
- Bumped (direct/replaced)
    - Go: v1.24.6 => v1.25.3
    - github.com/pkg/sftp: v1.13.9 => v1.13.10
    - golang.org/x/crypto: v0.41.0 => v0.43.0
    - github.com/rwinkhart/sys: v0.35.0 => v0.37.0

**libmutton v0.4.0**
August 17, 2025

This is the largest update to libmutton yet, and as such, these patch notes are non-exhaustive.
Many minor changes and fixes to features mentioned in these patch notes have been made.
Please see the commit history for a more complete list of changes.

## Breaking (for users)
- GPG has been entirely replaced with [RCW](https://github.com/rwinkhart/rcw)
    - All entries created in previous versions must be converted using [this conversion program](https://github.com/rwinkhart/sshyp-labs/releases/tag/v2.0.0)
- Steam TOTP keys now must be in base32 format
- (3c5db78da9861e09112ac308c086c2d19f2abfeb) Release binaries of `libmuttonserver` now target x86_64_v2 and arm64v8.7
- (3dd07e7165874e323586c21a14853935bb3dc61c) Offline mode is now manually specified in libmutton.ini

## Breaking (for developers)
- libmutton has been further modularized
    - The `core` package has been split into `core`, `global`, `crypt`, and `cfg`
    - The `sync` package has been split into `syncclient`, `syncserver`, `synccommon`, and `synccycles`
    - This decreases the size of the server binary and allows for more modular clients
- (40f0f35f452008997bb5ecfb72f496646c42ba06) Errors are now returned, rather than printed

## Features
- (111324cc25e84a5bd8b6b8206b90b00394311590) Deletions (server-side) now follow the client through device ID changes

- (bed23e987d89b133204991c2c34b8fa1e8e335c9) (41a12c6e4a7c09b22fac0faf6bdef5993264f5de) Added iOS clipboard support
- (3fdcc9e96d71bb4bef3baf9f43a627782237b142) (1a66a30bc184528ec971306497cca3597072202a) (d023058630958842f0f521ba2bef43b12955b9d8) Support one-time TOTP copy
- (fb2120c94ebc69f7ac8e15163f1e27b2c8057d9a) Support custom device ID prefixes

## Fixes
- (50ab27c6749d13fc6842d92259f8e0fd8fa5340c) libmutton.ini is now always created with 0600 permissions on *nix platforms
- (4a0e0f8e9e96805b27232001bce81336ac2e6a4d) Old devices IDs are no longer removed from clients when registration of a new device ID fails
