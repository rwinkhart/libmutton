**libmutton v0.2.1**
August 13, 2024

## Breaking Changes
- libmutton has been separated into its own repository and the "backend" package has been renamed to "core"
- Clients now must pass the return value of core.DirInit (oldDeviceID) to sync.DeviceIDGen
    - This is for the new device ID replacement feature
- (a1c9827c04bcf7da2baf59081885d0bf7d1c0ebc) The sync separator constants (FSSpace, FSPath, FSMisc) have been moved to the core package

## Features
- (7d51d12b5518f29e5e6ae7615e546f0df6dee941) (be46b0d6b29a16f1a5dd9ae08a63069ac7626a12) Clients can now request the server to replace their old device ID when changing to a new one
- (ed9c4e91ff67a27b9851a43bf9bed5fa404249b0) (4c54349b3929d7cc89e9fa051b89eaa6f4aeb6f0) Exit codes are now specific to the type of error encountered
    - (bb1ecc5bae8a004d1ae25705492be7d588aa5f7b) (cbf91397137c79a7e9483924a39ddecfab4817cc) More potential errors have been handled

## Fixes
- (9f433374373297709f7aa3b28e0204b46f67cd82) (e861b2b6f3e110ce7703b5c50d23b23787f22450) The SSH client is now only created once during RunJob (prevents multiple password prompts with protected keyfiles)
- (88b7a6be6d915aeee1b3e4ba52248a428e41bc3c) Config/entry files are now created with 0600 permissions
- (d67114b9ba6bd7a5888b843f25673bf80550bd54) The TOTP copy message is no longer unnecessarily verbose
- (06b9527a3373d8a677f93bccea447d45ea794c6a) Function documentation is now properly formatted for display on pkg.go.dev
