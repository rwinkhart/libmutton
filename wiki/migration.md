## Migrating From Other Password Managers
**Important Notice**: The libmutton entry format is not final and has two [breaking changes planned prior to release v1.0.0](https://github.com/rwinkhart/libmutton/blob/main/wiki/breaking.md). This guide will be updated accordingly.
### pass
#### libmutton < v0.4.0
libmutton-based password managers (prior to v0.4.0) use GnuPG encryption and an entry format similar to that of [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/). Because of this, any entries in `pass` format can simply be dropped into `~/.local/share/libmutton`.
#### libmutton >= v0.4.0
Current libmutton-based password managers use a custom, embedded cryptography agent ([RCW](https://github.com/rwinkhart/rcw)). The layout of the entries themselves has not changed, so gpg-encrypted entries (from `pass` or older libmutton releases) can simply be decrypted and re-encrypted with RCW. A conversion script will be published prior to the release of libmutton v0.4.0.
### sshyp
`sshyp`, though also `pass`-compatible, makes some changes to the entry format that take effect once the entry has been imported. The changes made by `sshyp` are not compatible with libmutton, and as such `sshyp` entries must be converted before they can be used. A script for exporting to libmutton (prior to v0.4.0) has been published to the `sshyp` extension store. Simply run `sshyp tweak`, go to the "extension management" menu, and download the "export-to-libmutton" extension. After doing this, the `sshyp export` command can be used to export entries in libmutton format. If migrating into libmutton v0.4.0 or later, a second conversion script will be needed to re-encrypt the exported `sshyp` entries; this script will be published prior to the release of libmutton v0.4.0.
### Other
The formats for many other password managers can be converted to the `pass` format with community scripts. Some of these scripts are listed [here](https://www.passwordstore.org/#migration). Once converted, entries can be dropped into `~/.local/share/libmutton`. If migrating into libmutton v0.4.0 or later, a second conversion script will be needed to re-encrypt the converted entries; this script will be published prior to the release of libmutton v0.4.0.
