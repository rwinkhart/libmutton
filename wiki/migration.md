## Migrating From Other Password Managers
### pass
Current libmutton-based password managers use a custom, embedded cryptography agent ([RCW](https://github.com/rwinkhart/rcw)). GPG-encrypted entries (from `pass` or libmutton releases prior to v0.4.0) can simply be decrypted and re-encrypted with RCW. A [conversion program](https://github.com/rwinkhart/sshyp-labs/releases/tag/v2.0.0) has been published for this purpose.
### sshyp
`sshyp`, though also `pass`-compatible, makes some changes to the entry format that take effect once the entry has been imported. The changes made by `sshyp` are not compatible with libmutton, and as such `sshyp` entries must be converted before they can be used. A script for exporting to libmutton (prior to v0.4.0) has been published to the `sshyp` extension store. Simply run `sshyp tweak`, go to the "extension management" menu, and download the "export-to-libmutton" extension. After doing this, the `sshyp export` command can be used to export entries in libmutton v0.3.X format. If migrating into libmutton v0.4.0 or later, a second [conversion program](https://github.com/rwinkhart/sshyp-labs/releases/tag/v2.0.0) will be needed to re-encrypt the exported `sshyp` entries.
### Other
The formats for many other password managers can be converted to the `pass` format with community scripts. Some of these scripts are listed [here](https://www.passwordstore.org/#migration). Once converted, entries can be dropped into `~/.local/share/libmutton`. If migrating into libmutton v0.4.0 or later, a second [conversion program](https://github.com/rwinkhart/sshyp-labs/releases/tag/v2.0.0) will be needed to re-encrypt the converted entries.
